All I know is that eventually, she let him go.</p>\n<p><strong>Red:</strong> What? Just like that? Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> Well, I can only say what my mother told me. She claimed it was because exposing him might have ruined her chances of being chosen as Grand Templar.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> But\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I believe that. If she really wanted to, I think she could have had him\u2026 <em>\u201cremoved\u201d</em> quietly.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> I think a part of her still loved him, but maybe that\u2019s naive wishing on my part.</p>\n<p><strong>Red:</strong> No, I get that. I mean, I grew up an orphan, but I can understand the desire of wanting parents who don\u2019t hate each other. Though, I gotta say\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t blame your mom if she did.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> Either way, I\u2019m thankful for my mother\u2019s mercy. As you\u2019ve probably guessed, by then she was already pregnant with me. It was a shock for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> My conception was made possible due to my father\u2019s transformation. However\u2026 the gods do not look kindly on those who thwart their laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Mary:</strong> <strong><em>Ah!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> I was born cursed \u2014 I inherited my father\u2019s gift, but none of his control. I\u2019m not sure which form I was born with, but I was either a Keidran from birth, or changed soon after, because I\u2019m told the midwife fainted.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> My existence was kept a secret from almost everyone. A High Templar giving birth to a Keidran would have been a scandal.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> I was given a locket to wear which kept my magic at bay, and then sent to live in a cabin far away from civilization. There were years of my childhood where I wouldn\u2019t see another soul, save for my caretaker. It was a lonely time in my life.</p>\n<p><em>Page transcript provided by amenon.</em></p>",

It wasn\u2019t so bad, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> My caretaker doubled as my tutor, and once I learned how to read, I spent most of my free time in books.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> You know it\u2019s kinda funny.
