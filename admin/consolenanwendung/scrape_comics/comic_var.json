He has suddenly fallen ill, and won’t be joining us. I will be taking his place. My name is Edmund Sirus Templar VIII.</p>\n<p><strong>Sirus:</strong> It has been over three hundred years since our ancestors first met and feasted with the Keidran, right here in this very village. And though the rest of the nation would rather forget this event, we embrace it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sirus:</strong> For tonight, we welcome our bestial brethren to join us once again, and for one night only, in our joyous celebration and feast! Let the festivities begin!</p>\n<p><em>Page transcript provided by amenon.</em></p>",

It’s the “Festival of Beasts.” Haven’t you heard of the old stories?</p>\n<p><strong>Natani:</strong> It’s said that over 300 years ago, the humans came here on a ship. The humans were naturally idiots and couldn’t tell food from their own dogs, so they began to die the first winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Natani:</strong> We generously gave the strange creatures our own food. After a while, it became a tradition, even after tension began to build between our two people. That is… Until Trace came to power four years ago and screwed it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Natani:</strong> We haven’t had a festival in four years. What I find odd is that it’s started up again now… The human’s Guild Master, appointed by Trace himself, put a stop to them, much to the disappointment of both sides.. I don’t see how they’re getting away with it this year, unless… Guild Master Tarron is no longer in command.</p>\n<p><em>Page transcript provided by amenon.</em></p>",

A High Templar giving birth to a Keidran would have been a scandal.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> I was given a locket to wear which kept my magic at bay, and then sent to live in a cabin far away from civilization.

It wasn’t so bad, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> My caretaker doubled as my tutor, and once I learned how to read, I spent most of my free time in books.</p>\n<p><strong>Raine:</strong> You know it’s kinda funny.

A pulsing glow, shifting from deep blues to eerie reds, bathed the surrounding mountainside, sending whispers through the city streets. Trace Legacy, the Grand Templar and Duke of Edinmire, returned only two days ago after an unexplained six-month absence. Now, with the estate coming alive in an unexplained way, speculation is mounting: Has the Duke resumed his magical experiments? “I saw it clear as day!” said merchant Claras Day. Eyewitnesses describe the lights as bright and unnatural, accompanied by faint tremors beneath their feet. “Duke Legacy is a powerful mage,” said Councilman Davien Rhys. “If he is indeed conducting experiments, we trust he is doing so responsibly. There is no evidence to suggest any threat to the city.” Not all citizens are convinced. Given Legacy’s infamous past and rumored instability, some fear his return could signal danger. Others wonder if he is attempting to reclaim his former position as the head of the Templar Order, a post he abandoned under mysterious circumstances. “If he’s experimenting, we should know.” cont. p3</p>\n<p><strong>Newspaper:</strong> <strong>ANOTHER DRAGON?
