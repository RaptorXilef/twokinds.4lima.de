A pulsing glow, shifting from deep blues to eerie reds, bathed the surrounding mountainside, sending whispers through the city streets. Trace Legacy, the Grand Templar and Duke of Edinmire, returned only two days ago after an unexplained six-month absence. Now, with the estate coming alive in an unexplained way, speculation is mounting: Has the Duke resumed his magical experiments? “I saw it clear as day!” said merchant Claras Day. Eyewitnesses describe the lights as bright and unnatural, accompanied by faint tremors beneath their feet. “Duke Legacy is a powerful mage,” said Councilman Davien Rhys. “If he is indeed conducting experiments, we trust he is doing so responsibly. There is no evidence to suggest any threat to the city.” Not all citizens are convinced. Given Legacy’s infamous past and rumored instability, some fear his return could signal danger. Others wonder if he is attempting to reclaim his former position as the head of the Templar Order, a post he abandoned under mysterious circumstances. “If he’s experimenting, we should know.” cont. p3</p>\n<p><strong>Newspaper:</strong> <strong>ANOTHER DRAGON?
